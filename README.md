# Naluri
Naluri Coding Challenge

# The problem
The Naluri space project is investigating how we could model the solar system. As a first step
we’d like to calculate the circumference of the sun.|

# The solution
1. Create an HTTP server that is capable of
a. Calculating Pi to increasing accuracy e.g. 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415… etc.
b. Everytime the server has calculated the next decimal precision, it should store
the most accurate value
c. When the server is queried via an HTTP GET request, it will respond with the
most accurate value that the server has calculated
2. Create a webapp that displays
a. The servers’ current known value of Pi
b. The circumference of the sun

# Consider the following:
1. Please calculate Pi algorithmically by using one of the known formulas
2. Initialize a git repo when you start your project and include the .git folder in your
submission
3. Feel free to use third party libraries in your submission for everything but the Pi
calculation
